#' Convert PLEXOS solutions to SQLite databases
#'
#' Functions to process PLEXOS solutions and dump them into SQLite databases that are easy
#' to read.
#'
#' \code{process_solution} converts a single zipped PLEXOS solution into a SQLite database.
#' The resulting database file has a simplified structure so data can be retrieved easily.
#' The temporary database contains the original data structure in the PLEXOS solution file.
#'
#' \code{process_folders} is used to process an entire directory. It searches each folder for
#' PLEXOS solutions and applies \code{process_solution} to each one of them.
#'
#' The default folder is the working directory. If the wildcard \code{"*"} is provided, all
#' the folders in the working directory will be processed (the list of folders if provided by
#' the \code{\link{list_folders}} function).
#'
#' @param folders Folder(s) to process (See details)
#' @param file Single PLEXOS solution file to process
#' @param keep.temp Should temporary databases be preserved?
#'
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{process_folder()}
#' \dontrun{process_folder("HiWind")}
#' \dontrun{process_solution("HiWind/Model WWSIS_c_RT_CoreB_M01_SC3 Solution.zip")}
