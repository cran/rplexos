Description: Efficiently read and analyze 'PLEXOS' solutions by converting them
    into 'SQLite' databases that can be easily queried. It supports collation of
    solutions that may have been divided into different time partitions,
    as well as the comparison across different scenarios. 'PLEXOS' is a power systems
    production cost model, created and distributed by Energy Exemplar
    (see URL below for more information).
