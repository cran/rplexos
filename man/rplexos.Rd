The following is the typical workflow:

\enumerate{
  \item Organize databases: copy all ZIP file solutions into folders with one scenario per folder
  \item Process folders: convert the ZIP files with \code{\link{process_folder}}
  \item Open databases: create an R object that holds the names of the SQLite databases with \code{\link{plexos_open}}
  \item Query data: use the functions documented in \code{\link{query_master}} to extract data
}

The list of available properties can be seen with \code{\link{query_property}}.

An example of this workflow is available in the "Getting started" vignette.
